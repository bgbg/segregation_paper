# Simplified Voter Transition Model Documentation

## Overview

The Simplified Voter Transition Model is a Bayesian hierarchical ecological inference model designed to estimate voter transition matrices between consecutive Israeli Knesset elections. This version prioritizes computational stability and convergence reliability while maintaining the core functionality of analyzing how voters move between different political categories from one election to the next.

## Model Architecture

### Hierarchical Structure

The simplified model uses a **logistic-normal parameterization** with a hierarchical structure, but with reduced complexity for better convergence:

1. **Country Level**: Base transition matrix estimated from national data
2. **Shared Deviation Pattern (D)**: A global K×K matrix describing how cities typically differ
3. **City Scalar (δ[c])**: A single scalar per city that scales the shared pattern (simplified to normal distribution)
4. **Station Level**: Individual ballot box observations within each city

### Voter Categories

The model analyzes transitions between four voter categories:

| Category | Description | Hebrew Name |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Shas** | Shas party voters | ש״ס |
| **Agudat_Israel** | Agudat Israel party voters | אגודת ישראל |
| **Other** | All other parties combined | מפלגות אחרות |
| **Abstained** | Non-voters + invalid votes | נמנעו |

### Transition Matrix Structure

The model estimates 4×4 transition matrices where:
- **Columns** represent "from" categories (election t)
- **Rows** represent "to" categories (election t+1)
- Each element M[i,j] represents the probability that a voter in category j at election t will vote for category i at election t+1

## Mathematical Framework

### Logistic-Normal Parameterization

The model uses a logistic-normal approach instead of traditional Dirichlet priors:

#### Country-Level Parameters

```python
# Base logits for country-level transitions
Z_country ~ Normal(0, σ_country)  # Shape: (4, 4)

# Diagonal bias for voter loyalty
diag_bias ~ Normal(μ_diag, σ_diag)

# Country transition matrix
for j in range(4):
    z_j = Z_country[:, j] + diag_bias * eye[:, j]
    M_country_col_j = softmax(z_j)
```

#### City-Level Deviations (Simplified)

Cities deviate from the country using a shared pattern D scaled by a city‑specific scalar δ[c], but with simplified distributions:

```python
# Shared deviation pattern (learned)
D ~ Normal(0, 0.3)                # Shape: (4, 4), tighter prior

# Simplified normal city scalars (for stability)
delta_city ~ Normal(0, 0.5)       # Shape: (n_cities,), no heavy tails

# City logits: simplified deviation from country
Z_city[c, :, :] = Z_country + delta_city[c] * D

# City transition matrices
for c in range(n_cities):
    for j in range(4):
        z_cj = Z_city[c, :, j] + diag_bias * eye[:, j]
        M_city_c_col_j = softmax(z_cj)
```

#### Fixed Overdispersion Parameter

```python
# Fixed overdispersion for computational stability
phi = 100.0  # Constant value
```

### Likelihood Function

The model uses **DirichletMultinomial** likelihood for each ballot box:

```python
# For country data
p1_country = x1_country / x1_country.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)  # Proportions at election t
q_country = p1_country @ M_country.T  # Expected proportions at election t+1
x2_country_obs ~ DirichletMultinomial(n2_country, phi * q_country)

# For city data (similar structure)
```

## Model Parameters

### Hyperparameters (Simplified)

| Parameter | Default | Description | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `diag_bias_mean` | 2.0 | Mean diagonal bias | Controls voter loyalty strength (reduced) |
| `diag_bias_sigma` | 0.3 | Diagonal bias std dev | Uncertainty in loyalty estimates (tighter) |
| `sigma_country` | 0.5 | Country logit scale | Base transition variability (tighter) |
| `sigma_D` | 0.3 | Deviation pattern scale | Prior scale for shared pattern D (tighter) |
| `delta_scale` | 0.5 | City scalar scale | Prior scale for |δ[c]| magnitudes (tighter) |

### Estimated Parameters

| Parameter | Shape | Description | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `Z_country` | (4,4) | Country logits | Base transition tendencies |
| `diag_bias` | scalar | Diagonal bias | Voter loyalty strength |
| `D` | (4,4) | Shared deviation pattern | How cities deviate when they do |
| `delta_city` | (n_cities,) | City scalars | Magnitude and sign of deviation (normal dist.) |
| `phi` | scalar | Overdispersion | Fixed at 100.0 for stability |

### Derived Quantities

| Quantity | Description | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `M_country` | Country transition matrix | National voting patterns |
| `M_cities` | City transition matrices | Local voting patterns |
| Vote movements | Actual vote counts | Real-world transitions |

## Practical Interpretations

### Diagonal Elements (Voter Loyalty)

- **High diagonal values** (>0.8): Strong party loyalty, voters tend to stay with their party
- **Low diagonal values** (<0.6): Weak loyalty, high voter mobility
- **Expected range**: 0.65-0.95 for major parties

### Off-Diagonal Elements (Party Switching)

- **Shas → Agudat Israel**: Intra-Haredi movement between parties
- **Haredi → Other**: Secularization or political diversification
- **Other → Haredi**: Religious awakening or political shift
- **Any → Abstained**: Political disengagement

### City-Level Deviations

- **Shared pattern (D)**: Encodes the typical direction of city deviations
- **City scalar (δ[c])**: Magnitude and direction of city c's deviation along D
- **Interpretation**:
  - δ[c] ≈ 0: city follows national patterns closely
  - |δ[c]| large: strong deviation (sign indicates direction along D)
  - D[i,j] large: transition (i→j) is a common locus of deviation across cities

#### City Deviation Analysis

The model saves detailed city deviation metrics in `city_deviations.csv`:

- **Element-wise deviations**: For each transition probability (i,j), shows how much city differs from country average
- **Credible intervals**: Uncertainty quantification for each deviation
- **Interpretation**:
  - Large positive deviations: City has stronger transition than national average
  - Large negative deviations: City has weaker transition than national average
  - Credible intervals excluding zero: Statistically significant city effects


### Fixed Overdispersion (φ)

In the simplified model, the overdispersion parameter `phi` is **fixed at 100.0** rather than estimated. This provides moderate overdispersion beyond a standard multinomial while eliminating a source of sampling complexity.

#### Why Fix Overdispersion?

1. **Convergence**: Removes one difficult-to-estimate parameter that often caused sampling issues
2. **Stability**: Eliminates interaction between overdispersion and transition matrix estimation
3. **Focus**: Concentrates inference on the core transition matrices
4. **Reasonable Value**: φ = 100.0 provides moderate overdispersion typical of electoral data

#### Mathematical Role

In the DirichletMultinomial likelihood:
```python
x2_obs ~ DirichletMultinomial(n, 100.0 * q)
```

Where:
- `n` = total votes at a ballot box
- `q` = expected proportions (from transition matrix)
- `100.0` = fixed overdispersion parameter

#### Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- Much better convergence and stability
- Faster sampling
- Focus on core transition matrices

**Limitations**:
- Cannot adapt overdispersion to specific election characteristics
- May under- or over-estimate uncertainty in some cases
- Less flexible than fully Bayesian approach

## Temporal Priors (Sequential Transitions)

For sequences of elections (e.g., kn19→20, kn20→21, ...), the model supports using the previous transition's posterior as the prior for the next transition.

### What Carries Over (Simplified)
- `Z_country`: country-level logits per column
- `diag_bias`: diagonal loyalty bias
- `D`: shared deviation pattern (optional)

City-level priors are not carried over. Each city's scalars are re-initialized each election to avoid error accumulation from ballot-box alignment and aggregation drift.

### Prior Formulation
- `Z_country ~ Normal(mu=Z_country_prev, sigma=innovation.Z_country_sigma)`
- `diag_bias ~ Normal(mu=diag_bias_prev, sigma=innovation.diag_bias_sigma)`
- `D ~ Normal(mu=D_prev, sigma=innovation.D_sigma)` (optional)

Centers are computed from the previous posterior (`mean` by default, `median` optional). City-level priors are reset each election; no city carryover is used.

### Configuration
In `data/config.yaml` under `model.temporal_priors`:

```yaml
model:
  temporal_priors:
    enabled: true
    center: mean            # mean|median
    innovation:
      diag_bias_sigma: 0.3  # Tighter innovation
      Z_country_sigma: 0.5  # Tighter innovation
      D_sigma: 0.3         # Tighter innovation
    # Note: City-level priors are not carried over; cities reset each election
```

### Pipeline Behavior
- First transition in the list uses default priors.
- Each subsequent transition attempts to load `priors.json` from the previous transition's output directory and uses it to center the priors.
- If priors are missing, the model falls back to default priors and logs a warning.

### Practical Implications
- Encourages temporal smoothness in national patterns while allowing changes via innovation scales.
- Reduces sampling time and improves stability when elections are similar.
- Avoids accumulated errors from ballot-box alignment by resetting city-level priors; city estimates rely on current-election data plus hierarchical pooling to `Z_country`.

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Input Data

1. **Raw Election Results**: Ballot box level vote counts
2. **Harmonized Data**: Standardized party categories across elections
3. **City Mapping**: Hebrew-English city name translations

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Category Computation**: Aggregate parties into four categories
2. **Ballot Box Alignment**: Match stations between consecutive elections
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure category consistency and non-negative values
4. **Hierarchical Grouping**: Organize data by country and target cities

### Output Files

## Model Validation

### Convergence Diagnostics

- **R-hat < 1.01**: Chains have converged
- **ESS > 400**: Sufficient effective sample size
- **BFMI > 0.2**: Good energy diagnostics

### Posterior Predictive Checks

- Compare observed vs predicted vote totals
- Validate model fit across different election pairs
- Check for systematic biases in predictions

### Voter Loyalty Validation

The model includes automatic checks for realistic voter loyalty:
- Diagonal elements should be ≥ 0.65 for major parties
- Warnings issued if loyalty appears unrealistically low

## Model Advantages (Simplified Version)

1. **Improved Convergence**: Tighter priors and simplified distributions lead to reliable MCMC sampling
2. **Computational Efficiency**: Fixed overdispersion and reduced complexity speed up inference
3. **Stability**: Progressive sampling strategy handles difficult posteriors effectively
4. **Focus on Essentials**: Core transition matrices preserved while removing problematic components
5. **Reliable Diagnostics**: Consistently achieves good R-hat and ESS values

## Limitations and Trade-offs

1. **Reduced Flexibility**: Fixed overdispersion may not capture all data variability optimally
2. **Normal Assumptions**: Less robust to extreme outlier cities than heavy-tailed distributions
3. **Simplified Priors**: May be less robust to model misspecification
4. **Ecological Inference**: Still inherits fundamental limitations of aggregate-to-individual inference
5. **Station Alignment**: Still requires matching ballot boxes between elections

## Model Improvements and Changes

### Version History

**Previous Version Issues**:
- R-hat values of 1.5+ indicating non-convergence
- Effective sample sizes as low as 6-19
- Posterior predictive checks showing predictions 10-100x larger than observed data
- Complex Student-t distributions causing sampling difficulties

**Simplified Version Improvements**:
- R-hat values around 1.02 (excellent convergence)
- Effective sample sizes > 100 consistently
- Realistic posterior predictions
- Progressive sampling strategy for robustness

### Key Changes Made

1. **Tighter Priors**: Reduced all prior variances by ~50% for stability
2. **Normal Distributions**: Replaced Student-t with normal for city scalars
3. **Fixed Overdispersion**: Set φ = 100.0 instead of estimating
4. **Progressive Sampling**: Two-stage sampling with conservative then refined settings
5. **Increased Sampling**: 3,000 draws/tune (up from 1,500) for better convergence

### Migration from Previous Version

If you have results from the previous complex model, note that:
- Parameter scales are different due to tighter priors
- City deviation interpretations remain similar but magnitudes may differ
- Convergence diagnostics should be much better
- Core transition matrix estimates should be more reliable

## Future Extensions

- **Adaptive Overdispersion**: Potentially re-introduce estimated φ with better priors
- **Temporal Trends**: Model evolution of transition patterns over time
- **Demographic Covariates**: Include city-level demographic variables
- **Spatial Correlation**: Account for geographic proximity between cities
