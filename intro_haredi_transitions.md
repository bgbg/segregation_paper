# Introduction

Across many democracies, certain communities exhibit cohesive voting patterns that resemble durable “voting blocs” anchored in strong group identities. Classic cleavage theories and the literature on ethnoreligious mobilization argue that such identities can cement stable partisan alignments over long periods (Koopmans and Statham 1999; McCauley 2014). Around the world, scholars highlight cases in which religious or sectarian authority, dense associational life, and social sanctions appear to reinforce partisan loyalty, creating electorates that look immobile from a distance (Massey and Denton 2007). This backdrop raises a central question for political behavior: are these loyal voting blocs truly immobile, or can hidden currents of change exist beneath an outwardly stable surface?

Israel’s ultra‑Orthodox (Haredi) Jews provide a compelling case study. The Haredi sector is widely portrayed as one of the most disciplined electoral blocs in Israel, with community members casting ballots in line with sectoral leadership and long‑standing ethnoreligious alignments (Friedman 1991; Curiel and Zeedan 2024). Academic accounts frequently describe strong homophily in Haredi voting—individuals support parties aligned with their religious‑ethnic community—while media narratives often depict the electorate as voting “in lockstep” with rabbinic guidance (Koopmans and Statham 1999; Curiel and Zeedan 2024). Yet this conventional picture leaves open whether electoral discipline fully suppresses volatility, or whether meaningful micro‑shifts can occur without altering headline outcomes.

Recent work on Haredi residential patterns revealed a surprising clue. A study using Knesset voting returns as a demographic proxy documented persistent **intra‑Haredi ethnic segregation** across multiple cities, but also identified an anomalous and **sudden drop in the dissimilarity index in Ashdod** around the March 2021 election (Gorelik 2025; Keren‑Kratz 2025). Unlike other Haredi centers that exhibited stable segregation levels, Ashdod’s Ashkenazi and Sephardic sub‑communities appeared to integrate more rapidly than expected for residential dynamics, and no clear institutional trigger was identified at the time (Gorelik 2025). This anomaly raised a broader theoretical puzzle: if people do not move that fast, what changed so quickly? One plausible answer is politics. If residential separation is comparatively slow to shift, **voting behavior can change quickly**, and such change might be most visible where social boundaries are already under stress.

The present study addresses this puzzle by analyzing **voter transition matrices** for the Haredi electorate across successive national elections. Using polling‑station results and a hierarchical ecological inference framework, we estimate transition probabilities among four categories—votes for Shas, votes for United Torah Judaism (UTJ/Agudat Yisrael), votes for other parties, and abstention—at both the national level and for key Haredi population centers. Three empirical findings emerge. **First**, the sharp timing of Ashdod’s segregation drop coincides with a **nationwide collapse in Shas‑to‑Shas loyalty** in the 2020–2021 cycle. While Haredi parties typically retain the vast majority of their voters from one election to the next, the **Shas retention probability fell abruptly in that period across the country and in most study cities**, with Ashdod showing an especially pronounced decline. **Second**, beyond this shock, we observe **occasional loyalty dips** throughout the study period, indicating that even highly disciplined electorates experience episodic slippage. **Third**, **city‑level transition patterns differ substantially from the national baseline**: established Haredi strongholds such as Bnei Brak and parts of Jerusalem remain closer to the bloc‑discipline ideal, whereas mixed or rapidly growing hubs such as Ashdod and Beit Shemesh display greater fluidity, including cross‑flows between Shas and UTJ and movements to abstention or non‑sectoral lists.

These results connect the segregation anomaly to electoral dynamics and, more generally, challenge monolithic narratives of Haredi political immobility. They show that **high cohesion can coexist with hidden volatility** that only becomes visible in granular transition analysis. Theoretically, our findings contribute to broader debates on voter‑bloc discipline and group cohesion by demonstrating that disciplined electorates may harbor **latent realignment pressures** that surface under specific local and temporal conditions. In this respect, Israel’s Haredi sector echoes a wider global pattern in cohesive minority electorates, religious constituencies, and enclave communities where collective identities shape voting but do not fully eliminate strategic switching or abstention at the margins (McCauley 2014; Järv et al. 2021).

Methodologically, our approach complements the segregation literature by pairing **aspatial evenness metrics** with **temporal transition estimates**. While the index of dissimilarity captures the structure of separation between Haredi sub‑groups at a given moment, transition matrices capture the dynamics of **how** voters move between partisan camps over time, including loyalty and cross‑over rates (Wong 2016; Fossett 2017). The Ashdod case illustrates the value of this pairing: where the segregation metric shifted abruptly, the transition analysis reveals an underlying electoral shock that aligns temporally and helps explain how a seemingly “fast” social change could occur without rapid residential mobility. More broadly, the city‑level comparisons suggest that **local institutional ecologies**—schools, synagogues, leadership networks, and exposure to non‑Haredi environments—mediate the strength of bloc discipline and the pathways through which volatility manifests (Flint, Benenson, and Alfasi 2012; Alfasi, Flint Ashery, and Benenson 2013).

The contributions are twofold. Substantively, we present evidence that Haredi voting, while highly cohesive, is **not** uniformly immobile: loyalty can weaken quickly, and local contexts shape distinct transition signatures. Conceptually, we advance a **spatio‑temporal framework** that links segregation structure to electoral dynamics and that can travel to other cases where cohesive identity blocs are thought to be politically inert. In comparative perspective, our findings speak to research on ethnoreligious parties, enclave politics, and minority representation, where understanding the conditions for both **stability and drift** is crucial for forecasting coalition behavior, policy bargaining, and democratic responsiveness (Massey and Denton 2007; Curiel and Zeedan 2024).

**Structure of the paper.** Section 1 reviews the literature on bloc cohesion, ethnoreligious voting, and segregation metrics. Section 2 describes the data and the hierarchical transition‑matrix methodology. Section 3 presents national and city‑level results, with attention to the Ashdod shock, episodic loyalty dips, and cross‑city heterogeneity. Section 4 discusses theoretical implications for voter‑bloc discipline and cohesive electorates beyond the Israeli case. Section 5 concludes with avenues for comparative research on hidden volatility in ostensibly stable voting blocs.
